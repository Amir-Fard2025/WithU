### About The Project

`WithU is a crowdsourced information platform aggregating resources that have been created to provide any kind of support to people affected by the war in Ukraine. It is meant for users who are seeking information, assistance or help as war refugees, their relatives, friends, or whoever else actively involved. Users can also create an account and actively add new useful resources to the platform. The resources are sorted into categories and can be also searched by respective tags. They can as well be ranked by other users.`
